Question 1. Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form? 
    A benefit to structuring HTML semantically is that we're more clearly showing the structure before the styling. Looking 
    at many popular websites, one will see that the html structure is "cluttered" with div tags. Using semantic HTML allows
    us to more clearly represent the website's structure.
Question 2. What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML? 
    If everyone used similar semantic HTML, we'd see more clearly how a website is structured pre-styling. For example, using
    a lot of div tags rather than a header (<header>), nav, aside, or footer tag, doesn't clearly portray how the website should 
    be styled. Using the same example from the last sentence, with many div tags, we're forced to search through the class 
    and id attributes to determine structure. Even if the website's developers are kind by using self-explanatory words in the 
    class and id attributes to show structure, it's still a hassle to read site structure. Semantic HTML also assists 
    screen-reader applications for people who need such assistance.
Question 3. What are some disadvantages? 
    Perhaps some developers don't want others to understand their code. If everyone used similar semantic HTML, it would be 
    harder to hide the structure behind their websites. Another disadvantage is that using div tags after div tags can be 
    easier. Rather than contemplating which semantic HTML tag should be used, why not use the "one-size-fits-all" option
    which is the div tag as it can be styled to represent anything.
