        <p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence 
            demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. 
            Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives 
            its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] 
            Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) 
            that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and 
            "problem solving".</p> <!-- I chose this tag because it introduces a large block of text-->

        <p>As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed 
            from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI 
            is whatever hasn't been done yet."[4] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded 
            from things considered to be AI,[5] having become a routine technology.[6] Modern machine capabilities 
            generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[7] competing at the highest 
            level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[8] autonomously operating cars, intelligent 
            routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations[9].</p> <!-- I chose these tags to represent large amounts of text-->
        <p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has 
            experienced several waves of optimism,[10][11] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding 
            (known as an "AI winter"),[12][13] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[11][14] 
            For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate 
            with each other.[15] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals 
            (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),[16] the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural 
            networks), or deep philosophical differences.[17][18][19] Sub-fields have also been based on social 
            factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).[15]</p>

        <h2>History</h2> <!-- I chose this tag because it introduces a new part to the main article-->
        <h5>Main articles: History of artificial intelligence and Timeline of artificial intelligence</h5>
        <p>Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[27] and have been common 
            in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).[28] 
            These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of 
            artificial intelligence.[22]</p> <!-- I chose this tag because it represents a large field of text-->
        <p>The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. 
            The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested 
            that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of 
            mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal 
            reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[29] Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, 
            information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an 
            electronic brain. Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent, to 
            "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".[30] The first work that 
            is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete 
            "artificial neurons".[31]</p>
